# Sum-of-5-integers

In this program, we use the Scanner class to read input from the user. We prompt the user to enter 5 integers with the message "Enter 5 integers:".

We use a for loop to iterate through the 5 integers. Within the loop, we use the nextInt() method of the Scanner class to read an integer from the user and add it to the sum variable.

After the loop has finished, we print out the sum of the 5 integers using the println() method.
